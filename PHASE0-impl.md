## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration System

All game balance is controlled through `GameConfig.luau`:
- **Player settings**: Health, inventory size, starting tools
- **Resource settings**: Node counts, hit requirements, respawn times
- **Tool settings**: Damage, mining efficiency, cooldowns
- **Time settings**: Day/night durations, transition times
- **Wildlife settings**: Health, damage, aggro ranges, spawn counts
- **Enemy settings**: Health, damage, spawn rates, difficulty scaling

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Resource System Testing
- [ ] Mine wood with axe (3 hits required)
- [ ] Mine stone with pickaxe (5 hits required)
- [ ] Mine metal with pickaxe (8 hits required)
- [ ] Verify tool validation (axe only for wood, etc.)
- [ ] Test inventory limit (blocks mining at 5 items)
- [ ] Test resource node respawning (30-60s delays)

### Warehouse System Testing
- [ ] Walk into warehouse to deposit resources
- [ ] Verify inventory clears after deposit
- [ ] Check team resource totals update for all players
- [ ] Test with multiple players depositing simultaneously

### Day/Night Cycle Testing
- [ ] Verify smooth lighting transitions
- [ ] Check timer accuracy (5min day, 3min night)
- [ ] Test phase notifications
- [ ] Verify UI timer countdown

### Wildlife Testing
- [ ] Bears and wolves spawn around map
- [ ] Animals attack when players get close
- [ ] Animals wander randomly when no players nearby
- [ ] Respawning works after death
- [ ] Damage dealing to players works

### Enemy System Testing
- [ ] Zombies spawn only during night
- [ ] Enemies pathfind toward warehouse
- [ ] Enemies attack nearby players preferentially
- [ ] All enemies clear when day begins
- [ ] Difficulty increases each night

### UI System Testing
- [ ] Inventory display updates correctly
- [ ] Team resources show accurate totals
- [ ] Phase timer counts down properly
- [ ] Health bar updates and changes color
- [ ] Notifications appear and fade correctly

## üöÄ Ready for Phase 1

Once Phase 0 testing is complete, the foundation is ready for Phase 1 features:
- Building placement system
- Structure health and repair mechanics
- Camp upgrade tiers
- Enhanced combat system
- Resource costs for progression

## üêõ Known Limitations (By Design)
- **Simple pathfinding**: Using basic MoveTo instead of advanced PathfindingService
- **No advanced animations**: Relies on default Roblox animations
- **Placeholder visuals**: Missing particles, sounds, and icons
- **Basic combat**: Simple damage dealing without complex mechanics
- **Fixed spawn locations**: Resources spawn randomly but locations aren't saved

These limitations are intentional for Phase 0 to focus on core mechanics testing.
