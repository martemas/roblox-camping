# **Dimensional Rift: Survival**

## Core Game Concept

A cooperative survival game where 5+ players must defend their campsite against increasingly dangerous enemies that emerge from another dimension each night. Success requires teamwork, strategic planning, and resource management across multiple in-game days.

---

## Game Loop

### **Day Phase**
- Players spawn at a central campsite in a procedurally generated forest
- Explore the environment to gather resources (wood, stone, herbs, metals, crystals)
- Risk/reward system: valuable resources spawn farther from camp
- Craft defensive structures, weapons, and consumables
- Prepare defenses before nightfall

### **Night Phase**
- At sunset, a dramatic visual shift occurs as the dimensional rift opens
- Enemies spawn from the rift in waves with increasing difficulty
- Players must defend the campsite using crafted defenses and weapons
- Survive until dawn to progress to the next day

### **Progression System**
- Each successful night unlocks the next enemy tier
- Multiple in-game days per enemy level (adjustable based on difficulty)
- Enemies stack as game progresses (Night 10 might have Zombies + Monsters + Goblins simultaneously)

## Enemy Tiers

1. **Zombies** (Nights 1-3) - Slow, basic melee
2. **Monsters** (Nights 4-6) - Faster, moderate HP
3. **Goblins** (Nights 7-9) - Cunning, use basic tactics
4. **Orcs** (Nights 10-12) - High HP, heavy damage
5. **[Additional tiers]** - Escalating threat levels

Each tier features:
- Increased HP pools
- Higher damage output
- Greater spawn quantities
- Unique attack patterns

### **Weapons**
- Melee: Swords, axes, spears (progressive tiers)
- Ranged: Bows, crossbows, throwables
- Magic: Elemental spells unlocked via temple discovery

### **Magic System**

## Win Condition: Portal Keys

Players can achieve victory by finding all 3 Portal Keys:
- Scattered randomly across the map each session
- Typically found in high-danger zones (far from camp)
- Once collected, team must venture to the Evil Camp
- Use keys to seal the dimensional portal permanently
- Game ends in victory, returning players to lobby

## Progression & Persistence

### **Between Games**
- Players retain character level and unlocked abilities
- Cosmetic choices persist
- Can voluntarily reset level for fresh challenge
- Matchmaking balances veteran and new players

### **Difficulty Scaling**
- Dynamically adjusts based on player levels in session
- Higher-level players face tougher enemies
- Ensures challenge for experienced players while accessible to beginners

## Player Experience Highlights

- **Teamwork Required**: No single player can survive alone
- **Strategic Depth**: Balance exploration, crafting, and defense
- **Replayability**: Procedural maps + different team compositions
- **Fair Monetization**: Skill and cooperation > wallet size
- **Progression Satisfaction**: Keep earned abilities between games
- **Multiple Paths to Victory**: Survive indefinitely OR find portal keys

This creates a tense, cooperative experience where communication and planning are as important as combat skills, with each session telling a unique survival story.
